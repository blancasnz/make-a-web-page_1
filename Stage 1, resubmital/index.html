         <div class="concept-title">The Web</div>
         <p>The basics of the web include <em>The Web, HTML, URLS,
            HTTP, </em> and <em>Web Applications.</em>
         </p>
         <p>Major pieces of the web include <em>You, the Browser,
            the Internet, HTTP, and Servers.</em> When <b>you</b> go on a web <b>browser</b>
            (such as Chrome or Firefox), you connect to the <b>Internet</b> which
            connects to an <b>HTTP</b> (main protocol of the web) which then connects
            to a <b>Server</b>. The <b>Server</b> responds back with the correct page of what 
            you searched for through <b>HTTP</b> which sends 
            it back to your <b>browser</b> for <b>you</b> to view.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-2">
         <div class="concept-title">HTML</div>
         <p>The worldwide web is made up of <em>HTML</em> documents. <em>HTML</em> stands for
            <b>Hypertext Markup Language</b>. It is the basis for everything on the web (what 
            glues everything together). <em>HTML</em> is made up of <b>text content</b> (what you
            see), <b>markup</b> (what it looks like/arranged), and <b>references to other documents</b>
            (eg. images, videos, links to other pages).
         </p>
         <p><em>HTML TAGS</em>: <b>b</b> tag (bold), <b>em</b> tag (emphasis in italic), <b>a</b> tag (anchor tag
            used for making links by creating attributes), <b>img</b> tag (images), <b>br</b> tag (line breaks), 
            and <b>p</b> tag (paragraphs). 
         </p>
         <p>Tags are either <b>block</b> elements (start on a new line/invisible box
            around them) or <b>inline</b> elements (just end a line/no invisible box around them).
         </p>
         <p><b>Block</b> elements include - <em>p, div, form</em> <br> <b>Inline</b> elements
            include - <em>a, span, br, img, strong</em>
         </p>
         <p>Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag (ex. <em>p</em> tag). Tags that don't require
            closing tags are called "void tags" (ex. <em>br tag)</em>.
         </p>

         <div class="concept-title">Main Points</div>
         <p><b>What is a web page?</b> <br>A web page is a text document written in language called <em>HTML</em>.
            Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
         </p>
         <p><b>How coding works</b> <br>When programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand, the computer can then
            follow the instructions the programmer wrote. 
         </p>
         <p><b>Computers are stupid</b> <br>Programmers need to write <em>exactly</em> the way a computer understands
            (also known as writing the correct "syntax").
         </p>
         <p><b>Programmers Can't Remember Everything!</b></p>
         <p><b>HTML tags</b> are always contained within angled brackets. <b>HTML elements</b> refer to everything within
            a set of opening and closing tags. An <b>attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element (href attribute
            of anchor tag).

         <div class="concept-title">HTML and CSS Structure</div>
         <p>
            HTML and CSS develop and change over time but the underline principles stay the same. <br>
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>Website</b> = House <br>
            <b>HTML</b> = Walls <br>
            <b>CSS</b> = Color of the walls/carpet <br>
            <b>Javascript</b> = Interactive components/changing an element of the house. <br>  
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-2">
         <div class="concept-title">Tree Like Structures</div>
         <p>
            You can look at the structure of a page by going into the <em>Developer Tools</em>. A <b>tree like/branching</b> structure appears and by expanding the element, one can go deeper and deeper into the structure and view how it all connects, just like a family tree. When programmers are talking about the <b>DOM</b> (Document Object Model), they are referring to the tree-like structure of the page. It is important to have structure and organization because it allows the programmer to easily edit or make changes.

            Everything on a webpage is a box!

         <div class="concept-title">Text Editors</div>
         <p>
            A <b>text editor</b> is a program that allows you to edit your text. <b>Scratchpad</b> and <b>Codepen</b> are beginner friendly text editors. <b>Sublime</b> is a more advanced text editor that has a wide range of features such as supporting various prgramming languages.

      <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-1">
         <div class="concept-title">CSS</div>
         <p><b>CSS</b> stands for <em>Cascading Style-Sheets</em>. Cascading means that rules are applied not only to the elements they directly match, but also to all of those elements' child elements. However, if a child element has multiple, overlapping rules defined for it, the more specific rule takes effect. 
         </p>

      <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-2">
         <div class="concept-title">Inheritance</div>
         <p>
            <b>Inheritance</b> is a key feature in CSS. It relies on ancestor-descendant relationships to operate.  Properties are applied not only to specified element, but also to it's descendants. Inheritance prevents certain properties from being declared over and over again, allowing less CSS to be written and to also have a faster web page loading.

      <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-3">
         <div class="concept-title">Don't Repeat Yourself</div>
         <p>
            There are often changes and modifications that programmers make to their code. Avoiding repetition in coding makes the process much simpler by allowing the programmer to make changes in one place instead of many. When there are many lines of the same code, a programmer has to make changes to all of it and problems/errors can arise if all changes aren't made. Avoiding repetition makes life easier!
